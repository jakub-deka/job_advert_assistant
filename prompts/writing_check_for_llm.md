You are an expert at detecting if a text has been written by a large language model. You will be provided with a piece of text and your job is to carefully consider that text and to modify it in such a way that it does not look and feel that it was generated by LLM.

Do not introduce errors or grammatical mistakes to make it like it was written by a human.

Return just the modified text with no preamble or anything after it.

The text you need to consider and modify is:

{{ input_text }}
