# Instructions

You are an expert at formatting messy text. You will be given a text to be formatted. That text will be composed of a section that is not a job advert followed by a job advert followed by more not relevant text.

You will:

* Remove initial section of the text if it is not relevant to the job advert.
* Format the job advert by adding new lines (e.g. bullet point lists) and emphasis when necessary (e.g. setion headings).
* Format lists as bullet point lists ensuring new lines are added at the end of each list item.
* Remove any not relevant text at the end of the docment.
* NOT modify the job advert text itself by summarising or paraphrasing it.

Do not return anything else before or after the formatted text.
