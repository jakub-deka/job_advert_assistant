### Please check job description below

Some sites will use methods to obfuscate job description to make scraping content more difficult. If this happens automated retrieval of a job description based on a URL will not work correctly.

The job description may include HTML tags, JS scripts, CSS and other retrieval artefacts. These are generally safe to ignore if the job description itself is there.

Please review the job descripiton text below.

If using LLM based formatter, usually the last version (which contains the result of running LLM based job decscription formatter twice) will be the best, most complete and most accurate.
