# Job advert analysis robot

Use Large Language Models to help you extract key information from a job posting and answer questions using natural language. Ask the LLM what is the salary or where is the office located.

Settings can be adjusted using the side panel.

The LLM has a set of information which will include the job advert. You can add relevant information to the LLM context using controls in the application. This can be things like your experience or the type of roles you are looking for.
